# Vivado_Scripting_and_Automation

## Description

ALEF_Vivado.ipynb (Automated Library Evaluation Framework) is a tool coded up in Python that automates the synthesis and implementation flow of Xilinx Vivado Tool by running Tcl Scripts for the input Verilog modules. Moreover, it generates both Synthesized and Implemented reports of power, timing, and utilization and combines several compononents of it as a CSV file. This tool is designed to automate both Verilog and SystemVerilog modules which are named as '''top_****''' (Make sure that your verilog modules and their filenames are same).
